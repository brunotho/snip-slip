 * - `loading` (Boolean): A flag indicating whether the snippets are currently being loaded.
 * - `error` (Object | null): An error object containing any issues encountered when fetching the snippets.
 * - `selectedSnippet` (Object | null): The currently selected lyric snippet for the player to interact with.
 * - `setSelectedSnippet` (Function): A function to update the selected snippet.
 * - `gameData` (Object): The overall game state, containing values like total score and rounds played.
 * - `roundHistory` (Array): A list of past rounds showing the player's progress.
 * - `handleSubmit` (Function): A function to handle submission of whether the player successfully used the snippet.
